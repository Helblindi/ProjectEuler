The nth term of the sequence of triangle numbers is given by,
tn = Â½n(n+1); so the first ten triangle numbers are:

1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...

By converting each letter in a word to a number corresponding
to its alphabetical position and adding these values we form
a word value. For example, the word value for SKY is 19 + 11
+ 25 = 55 = t10. If the word value is a triangle number then
we shall call the word a triangle word.

Using p042_words.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'),
a 16K text file containing nearly two-thousand common English
words, how many are triangle words?
